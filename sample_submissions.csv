S01,0,"A linked list is a sequence of nodes where each node stores data and a pointer to the next node.",90
S02,0,"Linked list stores data in arrays with index access",40
S03,0,"It is a data structure with nodes connected by pointers, starting from the head node.",88
S04,0,"A linked list is like an array but elements are stored in random memory locations.",65
S05,0,"Nodes containing data and a next pointer forming a chain, with head pointing to the first node.",92
S06,0,"Linked lists store elements in memory directly without pointers",35
S07,0,"A list of elements linked using pointers; the first element is called the head.",85
S08,0,"It stores data in arrays and uses index to access elements",30
S09,0,"A linear data structure where each node points to the next; last node points to null.",91
S10,0,"Collections of items stored in arrays with sequential access",25
S01,1,"Binary search has time complexity O(log n) because it halves the search space each iteration.",95
S02,1,"Binary search is O(n) because it checks all elements in the list",20
S03,1,"O(log n) — each iteration divides the array in half until the element is found.",93
S04,1,"It is O(n log n) because sorting is required before searching",45
S05,1,"O(log n) complexity since we divide the array by 2 every iteration.",91
S06,1,"O(n) time complexity because it searches through the entire list",20
S07,1,"Binary search is O(log n) as it divides the problem space in half each step.",90
S08,1,"O(n log n) because it sorts and then searches the array",40
S09,1,"O(log n) — logarithmic since search space halves each step.",95
S10,1,"Linear O(n) because it traverses every element",18
S01,2,"A hash collision occurs when two different keys produce the same hash index.",94
S02,2,"Collision is when the hash table is full and cannot accept more values",25
S03,2,"When two different keys produce the same hash value resulting in the same bucket.",96
S04,2,"Collision means the key is not found in the hash table",20
S05,2,"Two distinct keys map to same bucket; resolved via chaining or open addressing.",98
S06,2,"Hash collision is when the hashing algorithm crashes or throws an error",10
S07,2,"Same hash index for two different keys; resolved by open addressing or separate chaining.",90
S08,2,"When hash function returns error or duplicate key in the table",15
S09,2,"Occurs when two keys hash to the same slot; handled by chaining or probing.",93
S10,2,"When the hash table has no more space available for new keys",20
